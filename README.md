# My Personal Project

## What will the application do?
This program is a calorie tracker. It is designed to help users track and manage their daily food intake
and monitor their calorie consumption. The project is expected to provide a user-friendly interface that
allows users to input their meals and track the number of calories consumed for each meal.

## Who will use it?
**Anyone** who wants to maintain a healthy diet and achieve their fitness goals.

## Why is this project of interest to you?
There is a growing need for solutions that can help people make informed choices about their diet and
maintain a healthy lifestyle. The food calorie tracker project is a step in that direction, and it has
the potential to help people achieve their health goals and improve their overall well-being.

## User stories
- As a user, I want to input my information into the program and get my total daily energy expenditure.
- As a user, I want to be able to add food to my food bank.
- As a user, I want to be able to remove food from my food list.
- As a user, I want to view a list of my daily consumption of food.
- As a user, I want to be able to save my daily consumed food to food bank.
- As a user, when I start the application, I want to be given the option to load my daily consumed food from food bank.

### Task 3: Design Reflection

#### UML Diagram

![UML Diagram](UML_Design_Diagram.png)

The diagram follows a tree-like structure with
associations generally pointing in one direction.
There are no interfaces and abstract classes in the program.
The coupling is loose and the cohesion is high
for the most part since the program is relatively small,
though there are still many things that could be improved.
