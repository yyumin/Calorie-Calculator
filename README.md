# My Personal Project

## What will the application do?
This program is a local single-player 2D side scrolling game. Player can control the protagonist, attempting 
to move persistently to the right and between columns of barriers without hitting them. The game has different 
levels, each with increasing difficulty. The player is assigned with a health span. Once the player hits the 
barrier, he/she will lose some percentage of health. Once the health span is empty, the game is over. The game 
will settle a final score of how many barriers the player 
went through.

## Who will use it?
**Anyone** who is interested.

## Why is this project of interest to you?
I want to design a game that is intriguing, simple yet challenging. And the score feature can encourage a healthy 
competition among players.
